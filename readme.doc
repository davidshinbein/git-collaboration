Answer: We merged incorrectly, creating a three-way merge because changes were made to both branches beforehand. If done correctly, 
both merges would have been fast-forward merges, since the target branch (develop) would have always been an ancestor of the feature branch and no 
conflicts or separate histories would have existed.
