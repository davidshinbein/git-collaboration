Answer: We merged incorrectly, creating a three-way merge because changes were made to both branches beforehand. If done correctly, 
both merges would have been fast-forward merges, since the target branch (develop) would have always been an ancestor of the feature branch and no 
conflicts or separate histories would have existed.

B Answer: A merge conflict between develop and conflict_branch would occur if line 13 was changed to be "x" in the develop branch, 
and line 13 was changed to be "y" in the conflict_branch. When We attempt to merge the files, there will be a merge conflict. 

C Answer: A merge conflict would not occur if develop added a new paragraph saying "x" and conflict_branch added another new paragraph saying "y", because the changes are made to different lines.
